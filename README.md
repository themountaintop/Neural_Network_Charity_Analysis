# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to use a deep-learning model to analyze and then classify charitable donations. 

In this analysis I used:
* Data preprocessing
* Compiling, training, and evaluation of the model
* Different methods of optimization for the model

## Results
### Data Preprocessing:
* The column present in the data, ```IS_SUCCESSFUL```, contains binary data. As such, it was used as our target in the model. 
* Columns ```APPLICATION_TYPE,	AFFILIATION	CLASSIFICATION,	USE_CASE,	ORGANIZATION,	STATUS,	INCOME_AMT,	SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS,	ASK_AMT``` were considered features of our data and were used in training and testing data. 
* Both the ```NAME``` and ```EIN``` columns were removed from input data.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
